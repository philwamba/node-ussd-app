# node-ussd-app

This is a simple Node.js-based USSD application that handles basic USSD menu navigation and responses. It demonstrates how to build a USSD service with dynamic menus, error handling, and modular code design.

## Features

- **USSD Menu Navigation**: Supports multi-level menu navigation with dynamic responses.
- **Dynamic Content**: Displays user-specific information, such as phone numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs and navigation errors.
- **Modular Design**: Uses classes for cleaner code and easier maintenance.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: Main application file that handles incoming USSD requests and processes the menu navigation.
- `UssdMenu`: Class responsible for generating USSD responses.
- `UssdService`: Class responsible for handling the USSD session and navigation logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
